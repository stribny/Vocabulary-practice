# Vocabulary practice

Vocabulary practice is a very simple program for practicing foreign languages. Users have to 
provide correct translations for words that appear on the screen.

Users can choose what words they want to practice by choosing a dictionary file. All .txt files in the folder are automatically considered to be dictionary files. `English.txt` and `Deutsch.txt` are sample dictionary files.

## Run
